IMPORTANT: Soot is now succeeded by SootUp!
In December 2022, we have officially released SootUp, a version of Soot with a completely overhauled, more modular, testable, maintainable and usable architecture. Please check this out in case you wish to start a new program-analysis project.

Using Soot? Let us know about it!
We are regularly applying for funding to help us maintain Soot. You can help us immensely by letting us know about projects that use Soot, both commercially or in the form of research tools.

Also many thanks to JProfiler for supporting Soot with a free-to-use open source license!
